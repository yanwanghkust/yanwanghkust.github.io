    <b>Yan Wang<br/> Assistant Professor</b><br/>
    <br/>My work has been focusing on transport and mixing processes in the ocean. I have adopted
         ideas from both geophysical fuid dynamics and applied mathematics to study baroclinic
         turbulence over continental slopes and long range transport by coherent
         Lagrangian vortices. My approaches cover theory, numerical modeling, and observations.<br/>
         <br/>I obtained my B.Sc. Degree in Marine Science from Ocean University of China in June 2010 and
         Ph.D. Degree in Applied Marine Physics from the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, 
         University of Miami in December 2015. Prior to joining HKUST, I was a postdoc scholar at the Deparment
         of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles from
         January 2016 through August 2018.

    <b>Huaiyu Wei<br/> Graduate Student</b><br/>
    <br/>My research centers around using numerical ocean models to understand the dynamics of mesoscale turbulence 
         and eddy-mean flow interactions over topography.<br/>
         <br/>I obtained my B.Sc. Degree in Marine Science from Sun Yat-sen University in June 2019. 
         Prior to joining HKUST, my research mainly focused on coastal process such as wave dissipation 
         by costal vegetation and erodibility of cohesive sediment in salt marsh.

    <b>Xia Chai<br/> Graduate Student</b><br/>
    <br/>I obtained my B.Sc. Degree in Marine Science（specific training direction: Physical Oceanology and Marine Meteorology) 
    in 2016, and M.S. Degree in Marine Meteorology in 2019, both from Nanjing University of Science, Information and Technology. 
    Prior to joining HKUST, my research focus has been on the impact of typhoon on coastal ocean dynamics, 
    mesoscale eddy processes in the Agulhas system, and the interactions between mesoscale eddies and mean flows.

    <b>Lingyun Zhang<br/> Graduate Student</b><br/>
    <br/>I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Building Environment and Energy Application Engineering, 
    Chang’an University (2019), and M.S. Degree in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, 
    HKUST (2020). Prior to joining the Department of Ocean Science, my researches mainly focused on 
    mass & heat transfer and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

    <b>Junlin Chen<br/> Graduate Student</b><br/>
    <br/>I obtained my B.Sc. Degree in Marine Science from the Ocean College, 
    Zhejiang University in 2020 and my undergraduate study covered a wide range of disciplines, including physical oceanography, 
    marine chemistry, marine geology, and ocean engineering. Prior to joining HKUST, I had research experience in coastal sedimentology, 
    Weddell polynya in the Southern Ocean, river plume in Yangtze Estuary, and North Atlantic wave analysis. 
    Most of the previous work was data-driven. At HKUST, I will focus more on the physical mechanisms of oceanic motions over
    complex topography.
