    <b>Yan Wang<br/> Assistant Professor</b><br/>
    <br/>My work has been focusing on transport and mixing processes in the ocean. I have adopted
         ideas from both geophysical fuid dynamics and applied mathematics to study baroclinic
         turbulence over continental slopes and long range transport by coherent
         Lagrangian vortices. My approaches cover theory, numerical modeling, and observations.<br/>
         <br/>I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Marine Science from Ocean University of China in June 2010 and
         Ph.D. degree in Applied Marine Physics from the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, 
         University of Miami in December 2015. Before joining HKUST, I was a postdoc scholar at the Deparment
         of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles from
         January 2016 through August 2018.
